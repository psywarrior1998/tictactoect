Tic Tac Toe
=========================== 

A single and multiplayer tic-tac-toe game developed in _React js_ 

## How to play

The game is avaliable at [martchellop-tic-tac-toe.surge.sh](http://martchellop-tic-tac-toe.surge.sh/) and to play it, you need to choose between single and multiplayer.

To play single player, you will play as __'X'__ and the computer as __'O'__. Click the board to make your move and the computer will do his move shortly after.

To play multiplayer, the first person will play as __'X'__ and the second as __'O'__. You only need to click the board to play the game. 

In both cases, the move can't be undone and to change modes, you need to refresh the page. To keep playing in the same mode, prees the _reset_ button.

## Notes

The single player option uses an algorithm called minmax, you can read more about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) and look at a C++ implementation [here](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimax-algorithm-in-game-theory-set-3-tic-tac-toe-ai-finding-optimal-move/).
